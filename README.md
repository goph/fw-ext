**Extensions for [goph/fw](https://github.com/goph/fw).**

This repository contains extensions for [goph/fw](https://github.com/goph/fw).
It also acts as an incubator for new features, so for now
there is no BC promise for minor versions. Make sure to lock patch versions
instead (using tilde operator).


## Installation

Since this library uses [Glide](http://glide.sh/) I recommend using it in your
project as well.

```bash
$ glide get github.com/goph/fw-ext
```
